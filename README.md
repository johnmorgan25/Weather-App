# Weather-Journal App Project

# Application

I have edited the user interface so the UI become much more simpler. I have used an approach to avoid using snippets from the course.

# Test cases

-> If the search string is empty -> Displays: error you must provide a zip code (The input is empty)
-> If there is an error in the zip code or from the service -> Displays: error from the weather service (try typing wrong zip code)
-> If the zip code is correct -> It will display the temprature in celsius and the city name

# Notes

- I have used a snippet to avoid (error cors header ‘access-control-allow-origin’ missing)
- I have problem with posting data back into the projectData object, So I have rendered it directly to the User Interface
